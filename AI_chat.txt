I'll implement these additional preprocessing steps to prepare the data for model training. Let's create a new script called `advanced_preprocessing.py` that will handle these requirements:


Now, let's update the README.md to include information about the advanced preprocessing steps:


Now, let's update the requirements.txt file to include the additional packages needed for the advanced preprocessing:


Let's also update the run_all.sh script to include the advanced preprocessing:


Let's run the advanced preprocessing script to test it:

```bash
source 598_env/bin/activate && python advanced_preprocessing.py
```
We need to fix the stratified fold creation since we have a ValueError: "n_splits=5 cannot be greater than the number of members in each class." Let's update the advanced_preprocessing.py file to handle this:


Let's run the fixed advanced preprocessing script:

```bash
source 598_env/bin/activate && python advanced_preprocessing.py
```
We need to fix the issue with saving the folds since they have irregular shapes. Let's update the code:


Let's run the script again with the fix:

```bash
source 598_env/bin/activate && python advanced_preprocessing.py
```
We need to fix another issue with the random choice function when selecting the anchor and negative groups. Let's update the code:


Let's try running the script again with the fix:

```bash
source 598_env/bin/activate && python advanced_preprocessing.py
```
Great! The advanced preprocessing script now runs successfully. Let's confirm that all the output files have been created:

```bash
ls -la | grep -E 'loinc_full_processed|stratified_folds|stage1_triplets|stage2_fold|expanded_target_pool'
```
Let's check the stratified fold files:

```bash
ls -la stratified_folds/
```
Let's also examine a few rows from the generated triplets file to confirm they look correct:

```bash
head -n 3 stage1_triplets.txt
```
Let's check the Stage 2 triplets as well:

```bash
head -n 3 stage2_fold1_triplets.txt
```
Perfect! All the advanced preprocessing steps have been successfully completed. We have:

1. Created a full LOINC dataset filtered for laboratory and clinical categories
2. Generated stratified cross-validation folds while handling rare classes
3. Created triplets for contrastive learning for both stages:
   - Stage 1: Target-only triplets
   - Stage 2: Source-target pair triplets for each fold
4. Expanded the target pool for Type-2 generalization testing
5. Prepared L2 normalization for embeddings

The data is now fully preprocessed and ready for implementing the model architecture and contrastive loss function as described in the paper. 

All the required preprocessing steps mentioned in the initial list have been addressed:
1. ✅ Stratified data splitting for cross-validation
2. ✅ Triplet preparation logic for contrastive learning
3. ✅ Preparation of full LOINC dataset for first stage training
4. ✅ Expansion of target pool for Type-2 generalization testing
5. ✅ L2 normalization of embeddings

The next steps would be to implement the actual model using the T5 encoder backbone with contrastive learning using triplet loss as described in the paper.
