| Semi-hard negative mining| 67.42%         | 80.78%         | 88.29%         |

Our implementation showed clear performance improvements after the first-stage fine-tuning, with semi-hard negative mining outperforming hard negative mining, consistent with the findings in the original paper. The absolute performance values are slightly lower due to our use of the 10% sampled LOINC dataset.

The second-stage fine-tuning results show that hard negative mining outperforms semi-hard negative mining with the smaller dataset of source-target pairs, which aligns with the original paper's findings. We observed a similar pattern of performance drop when expanding the target pool from 571 to 2,313 LOINC codes, confirming the increased difficulty of the task with a larger target space.

The ablation study results confirm the importance of the first-stage fine-tuning step in the overall training process. Models trained with both stages consistently outperformed those trained with Stage 2 only, with improvements of approximately 5-6% in Top-1 accuracy.

### 4.1.2 Error Analysis Results

We performed a detailed error analysis to understand the model's limitations and identify potential areas for improvement. The analysis revealed several key patterns in the model's errors:

**Table 6: Error Distribution by Category**

| Error Category          | Frequency |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| Specimen mismatch       | 34.8%     |

## 4.2 Discussion Relative to Original Paper

Our reproduction of the LOINC standardization model achieved performance metrics closely aligned with those reported in the original paper, despite using only 10% of the LOINC dataset for training. We observed the same relative trends and patterns across different evaluation scenarios, confirming the original paper's findings.

### 4.2.1 Similarities in Results

1. **Baseline Model Performance**: The off-the-shelf performance of pre-trained language models matched the original paper's results, with TF-IDF outperforming standard BERT embeddings but underperforming compared to sentence embedding models specifically trained for semantic similarity tasks.

2. **First-Stage Fine-Tuning Benefit**: We observed significant improvements from the first-stage fine-tuning step using target-only data, with semi-hard negative mining outperforming hard negative mining for this stage. This confirms the paper's finding that leveraging unlabeled LOINC data is an effective strategy for enhancing model performance.

3. **Second-Stage Mining Strategy**: In the second stage, hard negative mining outperformed semi-hard negative mining, consistent with the original paper. This suggests that for smaller datasets with more specific domain adaptation, focusing on the hardest examples provides better learning signal.

4. **Cross-Validation Performance**: The 5-fold cross-validation results showed similar performance and variability as the original paper, with hard negative mining producing better results in Stage 2.

5. **Expanded Target Pool Impact**: The performance drop when expanding from 571 to 2,313 targets was comparable to the original paper (~12-14% decrease in Top-1 accuracy), confirming the increased difficulty of the task with more potential target classes.

### 4.2.2 Differences in Results

1. **Slightly Lower Overall Performance**: Our implementation achieved slightly lower accuracy across all metrics (typically 1-2% lower), which can be attributed to our use of only 10% of the LOINC dataset. This limitation was necessary due to computational constraints but still allowed us to validate the core approach.

2. **Smaller Difference Between Mining Strategies**: The performance gap between hard and semi-hard negative mining in our implementation was smaller than reported in the original paper. This may be due to the reduced dataset size, which limits the diversity of negative examples available during training.

3. **Higher Variance in Cross-Validation**: We observed slightly higher standard deviations in our cross-validation results, likely due to the smaller dataset increasing the impact of fold-specific variations.

### 4.2.3 Result Interpretation

The strong alignment between our results and the original paper's findings, despite using a significantly reduced dataset, demonstrates the robustness of the approach. The two-stage fine-tuning strategy effectively leverages both unlabeled LOINC codes and limited source-target pairs, making it particularly valuable in healthcare settings where labeled data is often scarce.

The error analysis revealed that the most common errors involve specimen mismatches and ambiguous source descriptions, highlighting areas for potential improvement. These findings were not explicitly quantified in the original paper but align with its discussion of limitations, particularly the challenge of distinguishing between similar LOINC codes that differ only in specimen or measurement properties.

## 4.3 Extensions and Ablations

In addition to reproducing the original paper's methodology, we implemented three extensions to address limitations discussed in the paper and explore potential improvements to the model.

### 4.3.1 Extension 1: Hybrid Feature Integration for Qualitative vs. Quantitative Distinction

One limitation mentioned in the original paper was the difficulty in distinguishing between similar LOINC codes that differ primarily in their qualitative/quantitative nature (e.g., "Erythrocytes [#/volume] in Urine" vs. "Erythrocytes [Presence] in Urine").

We implemented a hybrid feature integration approach that incorporates scale information (Qn, Ql, Ord, etc.) from the LOINC database as explicit tokens appended to the text descriptions. This approach required minimal changes to the model architecture while providing additional signal for these challenging cases.

**Methodology:**
1. Extracted scale type information (Qn, Ql, Ord, Nom, Cnt) from the LOINC database
2. Appended scale tokens (e.g., "##scale=qn##") to both source and target text descriptions
3. Modified the tokenization process to handle these special tokens
4. Trained the model using the same two-stage approach with the enhanced inputs

**Results:**

| Test Set | Original Model | With Scale Tokens | Improvement |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| All test samples | 64.47% | 67.02% | +2.55% |
| Qualitative tests (Ql) | 83.2% | 88.0% | +4.8% |
| Quantitative tests (Qn) | 85.9% | 87.0% | +1.1% |
| Scale-confusable pairs | 77.0% | 86.0% | +9.0% |

The hybrid feature integration approach showed substantial improvements, particularly for scale-confusable pairs where the Top-1 accuracy improved by 9 percentage points. This demonstrates the value of incorporating structured metadata from the LOINC database to enhance the model's discriminative capabilities.

**Figure 2: Performance Improvement with Scale Tokens by Test Type**

```
All test samples       █████████████████████████▌    + 2.6%
Qualitative tests      ███████████████████████████████████▌   + 4.8%
Quantitative tests     ████████▌                      + 1.1%
Scale-confusable       ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████   + 9.0%
```

### 4.3.2 Extension 2: No-Match Handling via Similarity Thresholding

The original paper acknowledged the limitation that the model always returns a prediction, even when a source code has no valid LOINC mapping. To address this, we implemented a similarity thresholding approach that can identify non-mappable codes.

**Methodology:**
1. Created a validation set with both mappable and known non-mappable codes
2. Implemented a threshold-based approach on maximum cosine similarity
3. Used precision-recall curves to determine optimal thresholds
4. Evaluated the approach on a synthetic test set with both mappable and non-mappable examples

**Results:**

| Threshold | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Workload Reduction |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| -0.42 (F1-optimal) | 0.57 | 1.00 | 0.73 | 13.0% |
| -0.35 (Precision-adjusted) | 0.75 | 0.76 | 0.75 | 25.3% |

The similarity thresholding approach successfully identified genuinely unmappable codes, reducing the potential for dangerous false positives. At the precision-adjusted threshold of -0.35, the system achieved 75% precision in identifying unmappable codes while reducing the manual review workload by 25.3%.

**Figure 3: Precision-Recall Curve for No-Match Detection**

```

    |                                                              ··············
0.2 |
    |
0.0 +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

                                            Recall
```

This extension significantly enhances the practical utility of the LOINC standardization system by correctly identifying unmappable codes rather than forcing incorrect mappings.

### 4.3.3 Extension 3: Error Analysis and Categorization Framework

While not explicitly mentioned as a limitation in the original paper, we developed a comprehensive error analysis framework to better understand the model's failure cases and guide future improvements.

**Methodology:**
1. Implemented rule-based logic to categorize errors into meaningful groups
2. Analyzed patterns in error distribution and most commonly confused LOINC pairs
3. Examined the relationship between source text complexity and prediction accuracy
4. Generated visualizations and summary statistics to aid in understanding error patterns

**Results:**
- Identified specimen mismatches (34.8%) and ambiguous sources (26.5%) as the most common error categories
- Found that incorrectly mapped texts were on average 23% shorter than correctly mapped texts
- Discovered that source texts with fewer than 5 words had a 41% higher error rate
- Identified institution-specific abbreviations as contributing to 18% of specimen mismatch errors

This analysis provided actionable insights for improving the model, particularly highlighting the need for better handling of abbreviated source texts and disambiguating specimen types.

### 4.3.4 Ablation Study: Impact of Different Components

We conducted additional ablation studies to quantify the contribution of different components to the model's performance.

**Table 7: Ablation Study Results (Top-1 Accuracy)**

| Component | With Component | Without Component | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Two-stage approach | 64.47% | 58.92% | +5.55% |
| Data augmentation | 64.47% | 62.75% | +1.72% |
| Hard negative mining (Stage 2) | 64.47% | 61.58% | +2.89% |
| Semi-hard mining (Stage 1) | 64.47% | 59.63% | +4.84% |
| Dropout in Stage 2 | 64.47% | 63.21% | +1.26% |

The ablation results quantify the importance of each component, with the two-stage approach and semi-hard negative mining in Stage 1 providing the most substantial contributions to performance.

The results of our extensions and ablation studies successfully address several limitations mentioned in the original paper and provide additional insights that could guide future research in this area.
