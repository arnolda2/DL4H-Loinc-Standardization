![Model Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/1i2g5Qk.png)

- **Backbone**: Pre-trained Sentence-T5 (ST5-base) encoder (frozen)
- **Projection Layer**: Dense layer (768 → 128 dimensions)

## Triplet Loss Function

```
L = max(0, D_cos²(f(xa), f(xp)) - D_cos²(f(xa), f(xn)) + α)
```

Where:
- f(x): embedding function
- xa: anchor sample
- xp: positive sample (same class)
- xn: negative sample (different class)
- D_cos: cosine distance
- α: margin hyperparameter (0.8)
