# Final Project Report: Automated LOINC Standardization Using Pre-trained Large Language Models

## 1. Abstract

This report presents our reproduction of the research paper "Automated LOINC Standardization Using Pre-trained Large Language Models" by Tu et al. We successfully implemented the two-stage fine-tuning approach described in the paper, which uses contrastive learning with pre-trained language models to map local laboratory codes to standard LOINC codes. Despite using only 10% of the LOINC dataset due to computational constraints, our model achieved performance metrics closely aligned with those reported in the original paper. We validated the effectiveness of hard and semi-hard negative mining strategies and confirmed the importance of the initial target-only pre-training stage. Additionally, we implemented three extensions to address limitations mentioned in the original paper: hybrid feature integration for qualitative vs. quantitative distinction, similarity thresholding for no-match handling, and a comprehensive error analysis framework. Our reproduction effort demonstrates the robustness of the approach and its potential for practical application in healthcare settings with limited computational resources.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.a. Paper Description and Contribution

The original paper, "Automated LOINC Standardization Using Pre-trained Large Language Models" [1], addresses a critical challenge in healthcare data interoperability: the standardization of local laboratory codes to the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) system. LOINC standardization is essential for enabling multi-center data aggregation and research, but the task is complicated by idiosyncratic local lab coding schemes and the vast number of potential LOINC codes (over 80,000).

The paper makes several notable contributions to the field of clinical data standardization:

1.  It leverages contextual embeddings from pre-trained language models (specifically Sentence-T5) for LOINC mapping, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering that had limited previous approaches. This is crucial as manual feature engineering is resource-intensive and often not generalizable across different data sources.
2.  It proposes a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy based on contrastive learning. This strategy enables effective training even with limited labeled data, a common scenario in healthcare. The first stage utilizes only unlabeled LOINC target data to learn general LOINC ontology, while the second stage fine-tunes on specific source-target pairs. This approach allows the model to benefit from the vast amount of publicly available LOINC information before specializing on a smaller, specific dataset.
3.  It demonstrates that a contrastive learning approach, specifically using triplet loss, enables the model to generalize to unseen LOINC targets without needing to retrain the entire model when new targets are introduced. This addresses a key limitation of traditional classification-based mapping approaches, which are typically restricted to a fixed set of known targets.
4.  The paper shows that this methodology achieves high accuracy in retrieving relevant LOINC codes. The authors demonstrate robust performance in few-shot settings and good generalization capabilities across different data representations and to new, unseen LOINC targets.

Unlike traditional rule-based or classification models, which often rely heavily on hand-crafted features or can only handle a predefined, fixed set of LOINC codes, the approach by Tu et al. offers both flexibility and scalability. The model is designed to primarily use free text information, minimizing dependency on complex manual feature engineering, and can theoretically map to any LOINC code in the catalog without complete retraining. This makes it particularly valuable for practical clinical applications where local coding systems evolve and new standard codes are frequently added.

### 2.b. Scope of Reproducibility

Our project successfully reproduced the key components of the original paper, including:

1.  **Dataset Processing**: We implemented the data preprocessing pipeline for both the MIMIC-III `D_LABITEMS` dataset and the LOINC database (version 2.72) as described.
    *   For MIMIC-III, we processed the data to obtain 579 source-target pairs with 571 unique LOINC codes, matching the paper's figures. Source texts were created by concatenating 'LABEL' and 'FLUID' fields, and all text was lowercased.
    *   For the LOINC target-only dataset used in Stage 1 fine-tuning, due to computational constraints (M1 Pro MacBook CPUs vs. NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs in the original paper), we worked with a randomly sampled subset comprising approximately 10% of the full LOINC catalog (around 7,800 unique LOINC codes) instead of the 78,209 laboratory and clinical LOINC codes used in the original paper. This sampling was done to maintain representativeness while ensuring computational tractability. Text representations (Long Common Name, Short Name, Display Name, RELATEDNAMES2) were extracted and processed.

2.  **Model Architecture**:
    *   We successfully replicated the model architecture. This involved using a pre-trained Sentence-T5 (ST5-base) encoder as a frozen backbone.
    *   A trainable dense projection layer was added to transform the 768-dimensional ST5 embeddings into 128-dimensional embeddings, followed by L2 normalization, as specified.

3.  **Two-Stage Training and Triplet Loss**:
    *   The two-stage fine-tuning strategy was implemented:
        *   Stage 1: Fine-tuning the projection layer on augmented LOINC target data (our 10% sample) using semi-hard negative triplet mining.
        *   Stage 2: Further fine-tuning the projection layer (with added dropout) on augmented MIMIC-III source-target pairs using hard negative triplet mining and 5-fold cross-validation.
    *   The triplet loss function with a margin \(\alpha = 0.8\) and cosine distance was implemented as per the paper's formula.

4.  **Data Augmentation**:
    *   We implemented the four data augmentation techniques described: character-level random deletion, word-level random swapping, word-level random insertion (using RELATEDNAMES2), and word-level acronym substitution.

5.  **Evaluation Metrics**:
    *   We reproduced the primary evaluation methodology, calculating Top-k accuracy (for k=1, 3, 5) based on cosine similarity between source and target embeddings. Evaluations were conducted on standard and expanded target pools, and on augmented test data for Type-1 generalization.
    *   Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) was also computed as an additional metric.

6.  **Ablation Studies**:
    *   We conducted ablation studies to assess the contribution of different components, such as the two-stage fine-tuning approach and the choice of mining strategies, mirroring those in the paper.

We were able to achieve performance metrics that showed similar trends and relative improvements as reported in the original paper, although absolute numbers varied due to the reduced dataset size and different computational environment.

**Baselines**: We did not attempt to reproduce the performance of other baseline models mentioned in Table 1 of the original paper (e.g., TF-IDF, USE, BERT, STSB-RoBERTa, STSB-BERT, ST5-large) due to time and resource constraints. Our focus was on reproducing the ST5-base model, which was the core contribution.

## 3. Methodology

```

### 3.b. Data

#### i. Data Download Instructions

Two primary datasets were required as specified in the original paper [1]:

1.  **LOINC Database (Version 2.72)**:
    *   The official LOINC table was downloaded from the LOINC organization's website: [https://loinc.org/downloads/](https://loinc.org/downloads/).
    *   Access to downloads requires a free registration with LOINC.
    *   We specifically used the `LOINC.csv` file from the downloaded archive, corresponding to version 2.72 as mentioned in the paper [1, Section 3.2].
2.  **MIMIC-III Clinical Database (Version 1.4)**:
    *   This dataset was accessed from PhysioNet: [https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/).
    *   Access requires completing a data usage agreement and CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) training on human subjects research.
    *   From the MIMIC-III dataset, we utilized only the `D_LABITEMS.csv` file, which contains definitions and local codes for laboratory tests performed at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [1, Section 3.1].

After downloading, these files were placed in a `./data/` directory within the project:
```
data/
├── LOINC.csv               # Main LOINC database file
└── D_LABITEMS.csv          # MIMIC-III laboratory items definitions
```

#### ii. Data Descriptions with Helpful Tables and Visualizations

##### LOINC Dataset
The `LOINC.csv` file (version 2.72) contains a comprehensive catalog of laboratory and clinical observations. Each LOINC code is described along six main axes: Component, Property, Time, System, Scale, and Method. The full LOINC database has over 80,000 distinct codes. The original paper used 78,209 LOINC codes belonging to laboratory and clinical categories for Stage 1 fine-tuning [1, Section 3.5].

Due to computational constraints, our reproduction used a randomly sampled subset of this dataset. We sampled 10% of the unique LOINC codes from the `LOINC.csv` file (approx. 9,848 unique codes, filtered down to ~7,800 after focusing on lab/clinical relevant classes). The following key fields were extracted for each LOINC code in our sample, as they provide textual representations used by the model:

| Field             | Description                                     | Example (`LOINC_NUM`="2160-0")              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| LOINC_NUM         | Unique LOINC identifier                         | "2160-0"                                      |
| COMPONENT         | The substance or entity measured                | "Creatinine"                                  |
| SYSTEM            | The specimen or system type                     | "Serum or Plasma"                             |
| SCALE_TYP         | Scale of measurement (e.g., Qn, Ql, Ord)        | "Qn" (Quantitative)                           |
| LONG_COMMON_NAME  | Full, unambiguous descriptive name              | "Creatinine [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma" |
| SHORTNAME         | Abbreviated name often used in EHRs             | "Creat SerPl-mCnc"                            |
| DisplayName       | Name suitable for display purposes              | "Creatinine"                                  |
| RELATEDNAMES2     | Synonyms, acronyms, other related names         | "Creat; Serum creatinine; Plasma creatinine"  |

All text fields were converted to lowercase. Missing text values were replaced with empty strings. Our sampled dataset was saved as `loinc_targets_processed.csv` or `loinc_full_processed.csv`.

*(Visualization of SCALE_TYP distribution in our 10% sample):*
The distribution of LOINC `SCALE_TYP` in our sample (and closely matching the full dataset statistics from `llm_research_paper.txt`) is approximately:
```
Quantitative (Qn): ~52%
Qualitative (Ql):  ~25%
Ordinal (Ord):     ~14%
Nominal (Nom):      ~8%
Count (Cnt):        ~1%
```
*(A bar chart similar to images/Distribution_of_Error_Categories_horizontal_bar.png, but for scale types, would be placed here.)*

##### MIMIC-III D_LABITEMS Dataset
The `D_LABITEMS.csv` table from MIMIC-III contains definitions for local laboratory items. Following the paper's methodology [1, Section 3.1], we processed this file to extract source-target pairs.
*   **Source Text Creation**: For each entry, the 'source_text' was created by concatenating the 'LABEL' (test name) and 'FLUID' (specimen type) fields, converted to lowercase.
*   **Filtering**: Only entries with a valid, non-empty 'LOINC_CODE' were retained.
*   **Result**: This process yielded 579 source-target pairs, involving 571 unique LOINC target codes, aligning with the original paper.
The processed data was saved as `mimic_pairs_processed.csv`.

**Example Source-Target Pair:**
| MIMIC Fields               | Processed Data        | Corresponding LOINC Info (from `LOINC.csv`)         |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ITEMID: 50912              | `source_text`: "creatinine blood" | `LOINC_NUM`: "2160-0"                         |
| LABEL: "Creatinine"        | `target_loinc`: "2160-0"  | `LONG_COMMON_NAME`: "creatinine [mass/volume] in serum or plasma" |
| FLUID: "Blood"             |                       |                                                     |
| LOINC_CODE: "2160-0"       |                       |                                                     |

##### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation was applied to both source and target texts during training [1, Section 3.2], as detailed in `data_augmentation.py`.
Techniques included:
1.  Character-level random deletion.
2.  Word-level random swapping.
3.  Word-level random insertion.
4.  Acronym substitution.

![Data Augmentation Workflow](images/Data_Augmentation_Workflow_for_LOINC_Standardization.png)
*This figure illustrates the data augmentation process, showing how original source and target texts are transformed into multiple variants for training.*

### 3.c. Model

#### i. Original Paper Repository
The original paper by Tu et al. [1] did not provide a public code repository. Our implementation is based entirely on the methodology described in their publication.

#### ii. Model Description
The model architecture uses a pre-trained Sentence-T5 (ST5-base) encoder as its core feature extractor [1, Section 3.4]. Our implementation is in `models/encoder_model.py`.

**Figure 1: LOINC Standardization Model Architecture**
![LOINC Standardization Model Architecture](images/LOINC_Standardization_Model_Architecture.png)
*This figure depicts the model pipeline, starting from input text, through the frozen ST5-base encoder, the trainable projection layer, L2 normalization, to the final 128-dimensional embedding.*

**Encoder Architecture (Sentence-T5 Backbone):**
*   ST5-base: 12 transformer layers, 768-dimensional hidden states, ~110 million parameters.
*   The ST5 backbone weights remain **frozen** during fine-tuning.

**Projection Layer:**
*   A trainable fully-connected (Dense) layer projects the 768-dim ST5 embedding to 128 dimensions.
*   This 128-dim embedding is L2-normalized before use in the triplet loss.

**Triplet Loss Function:**
The model is trained using the Triplet Loss function [1, Section 3.3], aiming to pull embeddings of similar items (anchor-positive) closer and push dissimilar items (anchor-negative) further apart. Our implementation is in `models/triplet_loss.py`.
The formula is:
\[ L(x_a, x_p, x_n) = \max \left(0, D_f(f(x_a), f(x_p))^2 - D_f(f(x_a), f(x_n))^2 + \alpha\right) \]
Where:
*   \(f(x)\) is the final 128-dim L2-normalized embedding.
*   \(x_a, x_p, x_n\) are anchor, positive, and negative samples, respectively.
*   \(D_f(u, v)\) is the cosine distance between embeddings \(u\) and \(v\).
*   \(\alpha\) is the margin hyperparameter (set to 0.8).

**Figure 4: Triplet Loss Concept in Embedding Space**
![Triplet Loss Concept in Embedding Space](images/Triplet_Loss_Concept_in_Embedding_Space.png)
*This diagram illustrates how the triplet loss aims to organize embeddings, ensuring positives are closer to the anchor than negatives by at least the margin \(\alpha\).*

**Model Inputs and Outputs:**
*   **Inputs**: Raw free-text strings (local lab descriptions or standard LOINC texts).
*   **Outputs**: 128-dimensional L2-normalized vector embeddings. During inference, cosine similarity between source and target embeddings is used for ranking.

#### iv. Pre-trained Model
We use the **Sentence-T5 (ST5-base)** model, consistent with the original paper [1, Section 3.4]. This model is optimized for sentence embeddings and available from TensorFlow Hub or Hugging Face (`sentence-transformers/sentence-t5-base`). Its pre-trained weights are frozen.

### 3.d. Training

The model is trained using the two-stage fine-tuning strategy from the original paper [1, Section 3.5].

**Figure 2: Two-Stage Fine-Tuning Process for LOINC Standardization**
![Two-Stage Fine-Tuning Process for LOINC Standardization](images/Two-Stage_Fine-Tuning_Process_for_LOINC_Standardization.png)
*This diagram outlines the two training stages: Stage 1 for target-only pre-fine-tuning using the LOINC corpus and semi-hard mining, and Stage 2 for source-target fine-tuning using MIMIC-III data and hard mining.*

**Stage 1 (Target-Only Pre-fine-tuning):**
*   **Data**: Augmented textual descriptions from our 10% sample of the LOINC catalog.
*   **Objective**: Adapt the projection layer to distinguish LOINC target concepts.

**Stage 2 (Source-Target Fine-tuning):**
*   **Data**: Augmented MIMIC-III source-target pairs (579 pairs).
*   **Objective**: Learn specific source-to-target mappings and jointly embed similar source/target codes. A dropout layer is added before the projection layer.

#### i. Hyperparameters

Key hyperparameters for training:

**Stage 1:**
*   **Learning Rate**: `1e-4` (Adam optimizer)
*   **Batch Size**: `900` (effective, or adjusted based on memory, e.g., 32-128 with gradient accumulation)
*   **Triplet Loss Margin (\(\alpha\))**: `0.8`
*   **Training Epochs**: `30`
*   **Triplet Mining Strategy**: Semi-hard negative mining

**Stage 2:**
*   **Learning Rate**: `1e-5` (Adam optimizer)
*   **Batch Size**: `128`
*   **Triplet Loss Margin (\(\alpha\))**: `0.8`
*   **Training Epochs**: `20` per fold (for 5-fold cross-validation)
*   **Dropout Rate**: `0.2` (before the projection layer)
*   **Triplet Mining Strategy**: Hard negative mining

#### ii. Computational Requirements
*   **Hardware (Reproduction)**: MacBook Pro, M1 Pro chip, 16GB RAM (CPU-based).
*   **Average Runtime per Epoch (Reproduction)**: Stage 1: ~45 mins; Stage 2: ~10 mins/fold/epoch.
*   **Total Training Trials**: Main reproduction run involved training Stage 1 once and Stage 2 over 5 folds. Additional runs were done for extensions.
*   **# Training Epochs**: Stage 1: 30; Stage 2: 20 per fold.

#### iii. Training Details

**Loss Function:**
The Triplet Loss (detailed in Section 3.c.ii) is minimized during both training stages.

**Online Triplet Mining:**
Batch-based online triplet mining was employed:
*   **Semi-hard Negative Mining (Stage 1)**: Selects challenging but not overly difficult negatives.
*   **Hard Negative Mining (Stage 2)**: Focuses on the most difficult negative examples in each batch.
This logic is implemented in `models/triplet_loss.py` and `models/train.py`. Training was done using custom loops with `tf.GradientTape`.

### 3.e. Evaluation

#### i. Descriptions of Metrics
Primary evaluation metric is **Top-k Accuracy** (k=1, 3, 5) [1, Section 3.6].
*   This measures the percentage of test samples where the correct target LOINC is among the model's top *k* predictions, ranked by cosine similarity.

We also computed **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**.
*   MRR is the average of the reciprocal ranks of the first correct LOINC code.

**Evaluation Scenarios:**
1.  **Standard Target Pool**: Against 571 unique LOINC codes from MIMIC-III.
2.  **Expanded Target Pool (Type-2 Generalization)**: Against ~2300 unique LOINC codes (MIMIC LOINCs + common LOINCs).
3.  **Augmented Test Data (Type-1 Generalization)**: On synthetically varied source texts.
4.  **Cross-Validation Performance**: Averaged over 5 folds for Stage 2.

The `models/evaluation.py` script handles these evaluations.

## 4. Results

This section presents the performance of our reproduced LOINC standardization model, a discussion comparing these results to the original paper [1], and details the outcomes of our implemented extensions and ablation studies.

### 4.b. Discussion of Results vs. Original Paper

Our reproduction efforts yielded performance trends generally consistent with those reported by Tu et al. [1], though absolute accuracy figures show some variations, primarily attributable to differences in the scale of data used for Stage 1 pre-fine-tuning and computational environment disparities.

*   **Baseline Performance & Fine-tuning**: The original paper's ST5-base model achieved 54.06% Top-1 accuracy off-the-shelf. After their full two-stage fine-tuning, this rose to 65.53% Top-1 (571 targets, augmented test set) [1, Tables 1 & 4]. Our reproduced model achieved 72.1% Top-1 under similar conditions (augmented test, standard pool). This suggests that our fine-tuning process on the 10% LOINC sample for Stage 1 and the MIMIC-III data for Stage 2 was effective, potentially even optimizing well for the specific MIMIC-III test distribution. The crucial takeaway from both studies is the substantial performance gain achieved through the two-stage contrastive fine-tuning process over the raw pre-trained model.

*   **Impact of Expanded Target Pool**: Tu et al. reported a drop in Top-1 accuracy from 65.53% to 56.95% (approx. -13.1% relative) when expanding the target pool from 571 to 2313 LOINCs for augmented test data. Our model saw a drop from 72.1% to 50.7% (approx. -29.7% relative) when moving from our 571-target pool to our ~2300 target expanded pool on augmented test data. Both results confirm the task's increased difficulty with more distractors. The larger relative drop in our case might be due to our Stage 1 pre-fine-tuning being on a smaller subset of the LOINC ontology, potentially making it less robust when faced with a vastly larger set of candidate targets it had less exposure to initially.

*   **Robustness to Source Text Variation (Augmentation)**: Both our study and the original paper found that the model maintains strong performance on augmented test data. The original paper showed a slight increase (63.70% to 65.53% Top-1 for non-aug vs. aug test sets). Our reproduction also showed a slight increase (70.2% to 72.1% Top-1 for non-aug vs. aug test sets on standard pool). This confirms that the data augmentation strategies make the model more resilient to variations in source text.

*   **Two-Stage Fine-Tuning Efficacy**: The original paper's Table 4 showed an improvement of about 5.7 absolute percentage points in Top-1 accuracy when using Stage 1 + Stage 2 compared to Stage 2 only. Our ablation study (Table 2, Figure 6) demonstrated an even more pronounced benefit of 8.4 absolute percentage points for the two-stage approach. This strongly validates the utility of the initial target-only pre-fine-tuning.

*   **Triplet Mining Strategies**: Consistent with the original paper, our Stage 1 fine-tuning (using the larger, albeit sampled, LOINC corpus) benefited most from semi-hard negative mining. For Stage 2, with the smaller MIMIC-III dataset, hard negative mining yielded better results in our ablation analysis (Table 2), confirming the paper's observation that harder negatives are more beneficial for smaller, specific fine-tuning datasets.

**Reasons for Discrepancies**:
    *   **Dataset Size for Stage 1**: The most significant difference is our 10% sample of the LOINC catalog for Stage 1 versus the ~78k LOINC codes in the original study. This difference impacts the richness of the ontology learned by the projection layer during the initial pre-fine-tuning.
    *   **Computational Differences**: CPU-based training (M1 Pro) versus GPU (NVIDIA V100) can affect training dynamics.
    *   **Implementation Nuances**: Minor variations in augmentation parameters, optimizer details beyond learning rate, or exact composition of the expanded target pool (since the "top 2000 common LOINCs" list was not provided) could lead to differences.

Despite these, the concordance in observed trends (e.g., impact of expanded pool, benefits of two-stage tuning and specific mining strategies) confirms the reproducibility of the paper's core methodological contributions.

### 4.c. Additional Extensions or Ablations

We implemented three extensions, assisted by an LLM for brainstorming and initial coding, to address limitations identified in the original paper or to further explore the model's capabilities.

**1. Hybrid Feature Integration for Qualitative vs. Quantitative Distinction (Scale Token Extension)**
*   **Motivation**: To address the paper's acknowledged difficulty [1, Section 5] in distinguishing LOINC codes differing mainly by scale type (e.g., "Presence" vs. a numeric measure), which is clinically critical.
*   **Implementation**: We appended "scale tokens" (e.g., `##scale=ql##`, `##scale=qn##`) derived from LOINC's `SCALE_TYP` field to text descriptions. This approach, using sentinel tokens, required minimal architectural change. If source scale was unknown, `##scale=unk##` was used. LLM helped design the token format and initial code for data pipeline integration (`scale_token_utils.py`, `process_loinc.py`).
*   **Results & Discussion**: This extension, detailed in `llm_research_paper.txt` (Section VIII), yielded marked improvements.
    *   Top-1 accuracy on "scale-confusable pairs" improved by **+9.0%** (from 77.0% to 86.0%).
    *   Performance on high-risk assays like Drug Screens increased by **+10.4%**.
    *   Overall Top-1 accuracy across all test samples improved by +2.55% (within its specific experimental setup).
    *   An ablation study replacing true scale tokens with `##scale=unk##` confirmed the gains were from the scale information.

    *Figure 8: Impact of the Scale Token extension on Top-1 accuracy across different test categories, demonstrating significant improvement on scale-confusable pairs and high-risk assays.*

**2. No-Match Handling via Similarity Thresholding and Negative Mining**
*   **Motivation**: The original model always forces a mapping. This extension addresses the real-world need to identify local codes with no valid LOINC match [1, Section 5].
*   **Implementation**: A cosine similarity threshold (\(\tau\)) was introduced. If a source text's maximum similarity to any target LOINC falls below \(\tau\), it's flagged "Unmappable." The threshold was tuned on a validation set (including known non-mappable codes like radiological procedures from `D_LABITEMS.csv` where `LOINC_CODE` is null). We also explored mining "hard negatives." LLM assisted in drafting code for `threshold_negatives_handler.py`, `negative_mining.py`, and related evaluation scripts.
*   **Results & Discussion**: Detailed in `llm_research_paper.txt` (Sections IX & X).
    *   A precision-adjusted threshold of -0.35 (cosine similarity) yielded ~75% precision and ~76% recall in identifying unmappable codes, with an F1-score of 0.75.
    *   This setting offered an estimated Subject Matter Expert (SME) workload reduction of 25.3%.

**3. Comprehensive Error Analysis Framework and Ablations**
*   **Motivation**: To understand failure modes beyond aggregate metrics and quantify component contributions.
*   **Implementation**: An error analysis script (`models/error_analysis.py`) was developed to categorize errors (e.g., Property Mismatch, Specimen Mismatch). Ablation studies (`models/ablation_study.py`) were performed on key components. LLM helped structure these scripts.
*   **Results & Discussion**:
    *   Error Analysis (Figure 7): Specimen Mismatches (34.8%) and Ambiguous Sources (26.5%) were the most frequent error types. Shorter texts and abbreviations correlated with higher error rates.
    *   Ablations (Table 2, Figure 6): Confirmed the substantial +8.4% Top-1 benefit of two-stage fine-tuning and the +2.9% advantage of hard negative mining in Stage 2 over semi-hard. Data augmentation also showed a positive impact.

These extensions enhance the model's practical utility and provide deeper insights into its behavior, leveraging LLM assistance for ideation and initial implementation.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.a. Implications of the Experimental Results

Our reproduction of the LOINC standardization model by Tu et al. [1] successfully validated the core tenets of their approach and yielded several important implications. The consistent performance patterns observed, despite using a significantly reduced dataset (10% of the LOINC catalog for Stage 1 pre-fine-tuning) and less powerful computational resources (CPU vs. GPU), underscore the robustness and potential efficiency of the proposed two-stage contrastive learning framework with pre-trained Sentence-T5 embeddings.

**Key Implications:**

1.  **Effectiveness of Pre-trained LLMs and Contrastive Learning**: Our results reaffirm that leveraging large pre-trained language models like Sentence-T5, combined with a contrastive learning objective (Triplet Loss), is a powerful strategy for semantic mapping tasks in specialized domains like clinical terminology. It effectively reduces the need for extensive manual feature engineering.
2.  **Value of Two-Stage Fine-Tuning**: The ablation studies, both in the original paper and our reproduction, strongly highlight the benefit of the two-stage fine-tuning strategy. The initial stage, using only unlabeled LOINC target descriptions, allows the model to learn the inherent structure and nuances of the target ontology before specializing on the much smaller set of labeled source-target pairs. Our reproduction showed an 8.4% absolute improvement in Top-1 accuracy from this first stage, confirming its critical role.
3.  **Scalability and Generalization Potential**: While absolute performance drops with larger target pools (as seen in both studies), the contrastive approach intrinsically supports generalization to unseen targets without retraining the core model. Our extensions further explored this; the no-match handling capability, for instance, allows the model to be queried against a much larger set of LOINCs (even the full catalog with pre-computed embeddings) while providing a mechanism to reject poor matches.
4.  **Dataset Size vs. Performance**: An interesting finding was that our model, trained on only 10% of the LOINC data for Stage 1, achieved Top-1 accuracy on the standard 571-target MIMIC-III test set (70.2% on original test data, 72.1% on augmented) that was comparable or even slightly exceeded the reported fine-tuned ST5-base results from the original paper (63.70% for original test, 65.53% for augmented test). This suggests the method might be quite data-efficient for the initial target-only pre-fine-tuning, or that our specific 10% sample, augmentation, or hyperparameter interpretation was particularly effective for the MIMIC-III test set. However, the larger drop in performance on our expanded pool compared to the paper's hints that the full LOINC dataset is indeed beneficial for broader generalization.
5.  **Practical Applicability with Extensions**: The extensions we implemented (scale-token integration for Qual/Quan distinction and no-match handling) demonstrate that the base model is extensible and can be adapted to address critical real-world clinical needs, significantly improving its safety and utility. The +9% accuracy gain on scale-confusable pairs with minimal architectural change is particularly noteworthy.

**Reproducibility Assessment:**
The original paper by Tu et al. [1] is **largely reproducible with moderate effort**, provided access to the MIMIC-III and LOINC datasets. We were able to:
*   Successfully implement the described data processing steps for both MIMIC-III and LOINC, matching the source-target pair counts from the paper.
*   Replicate the core model architecture (frozen ST5-base + trainable projection layer) and the triplet loss function.
*   Implement the two-stage fine-tuning process, including data augmentation and the specified triplet mining strategies (semi-hard for Stage 1, hard for Stage 2).
*   Achieve Top-k accuracy results that showed similar trends (e.g., impact of expanded pool, benefit of Stage 1) and were in a comparable range to the original paper's ST5-base results, especially considering our data and compute limitations.
*   Validate the key ablation finding regarding the importance of the first pre-fine-tuning stage.

**Factors that made identical, bit-for-bit reproduction challenging were:**
1.  **Computational Resource Disparity**: The primary challenge was the difference in computational power (our M1 Pro CPUs vs. their NVIDIA V100 GPUs). This impacts training time and potentially the scale of experimentation.
2.  **Dataset Scale for Stage 1**: Our use of a 10% sample of the LOINC data for Stage 1 is the most significant deviation. While results were still strong, fine-tuning on the full 78k LOINC codes, as done in the paper, would undoubtedly provide a more robust understanding of the LOINC ontology for the projection layer.
3.  **Hyperparameter Specifics**: Some hyperparameter choices or minor implementation details (e.g., exact architecture of the projection layer, specific parameters for Adam optimizer beyond learning rate) were not exhaustively detailed, requiring some interpretation.
4.  **Baseline Reproduction**: We did not attempt to reproduce the baseline models (TF-IDF, BERT, USE) from Table 1 of the original paper due to focus and resource constraints.

Despite these factors, the core claims and the effectiveness of the proposed T5-based approach were validated.

### 5.b. What Was Easy?

Several aspects of the reproduction process were relatively straightforward:
1.  **Understanding the Core Methodology**: The paper's description of the problem, the two-stage fine-tuning, and the contrastive learning objective was conceptually clear.
2.  **Model Architecture Implementation**: Implementing the frozen ST5-encoder with a trainable projection layer was facilitated by libraries like Hugging Face Transformers and TensorFlow/Keras.
3.  **Data Source Identification**: MIMIC-III and LOINC datasets were clearly specified. The basic processing for MIMIC-III source-target pairs was explicit.
4.  **Evaluation Metrics**: Top-k accuracy is a standard and implementable metric.
5.  **Interpreting Core Result Trends**: Observed performance trends generally mirrored the original paper's findings.

### 5.c. What Was Difficult?

Key challenges encountered during reproduction included:
1.  **Computational Resources and Time**: Training LLMs on CPUs (M1 Pro MacBooks) was time-intensive compared to the V100 GPUs used in the original study. Memory management for large embedding sets also required careful batching.
2.  **Triplet Mining Implementation**: Developing efficient and correct online triplet mining (hard and semi-hard) was technically demanding.
3.  **Hyperparameter Specificity**: While major hyperparameters were given, finer details common in deep learning replication were not fully available, necessitating some degree of re-tuning or assumption.
4.  **Data Augmentation Details**: Specific parameters for augmentation techniques were not provided, requiring us to implement reasonable approximations.
5.  **Full-Scale LOINC Data**: Handling and augmenting the full 78k LOINC codes for Stage 1 would be a very large data processing task, which we mitigated by sampling.
6.  **Expanded Target Pool Composition**: Recreating the "top 2000 common LOINCs" exactly was not possible without the original list.

### 5.d. Recommendations to Original Authors or Others for Improving Reproducibility

To enhance the reproducibility of similar research:
1.  **Provide Code**: Sharing core data preprocessing, model, loss function, and training/evaluation scripts is invaluable.
2.  **Detail All Hyperparameters**: A comprehensive list, including optimizer specifics (betas, weight decay) and any learning rate schedules.
3.  **Specify Augmentation Parameters**: Detail probabilities, rates, and sources for each data augmentation technique.
4.  **Share Dataset Identifiers/Sampling Strategy**: For large public datasets like LOINC, provide lists of identifiers used or the exact random sampling methodology.
5.  **Document Computational Environment**: Provide specifics on hardware, library versions, and approximate runtimes.
6.  **Clarify Architectural Details**: For custom layers (like the projection head), specify activation functions or initializers if non-standard.
7.  **Offer Resource-Constrained Alternatives**: Suggest adaptations for setups with limited compute, if feasible.
